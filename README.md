# ANDELA BOOTCAMP PROJECTS

###OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING ###

 This implements the object oriented paradigm. In this project Animal was used to model a class for different types of animal.
 Any type of animal can inherit from the Animal class.
 
 
 ###DATA TYPE PROGRAMMING TASK 
 This implements a programming logic that checks the the data type of the passed in input and return appropriate messages.
 
 ###FINDING THE PRIME NUMBERS IN A SEQUENCE 
 This is a programming logic that filters out the prime numbers within a sequence of numbers based on the passed in limit of the sequence.

###About Cart
Cart helps people to keep track of the items when they are shopping to have a knowledge of how many items they are going to purchase finally.

###Objectives
We are going to build a simple Shopping Cart application that will be executed from the browser.

###Features
The Shopping Cart application should enable users:
  + Add new items to Cart
  + Update items in the Cart.
  + Delete items from the Cart.

The Shopping Cart application may possess additional features such as:
  + Persisting the tasks to the browser's local storage.

###Functionality
  +  **Adding new items to Cart**
  When the user clicks the 'Add To Cart' button after typing text into the various input fields, a new item is added to the Cart and appears below the previous task.
  +  **Update items in the Cart**
  When the user clicks on the 'edit' button, the user should be able to edit the items in the Cart and press ENTER to update those values.
  +  **Deleting items from the Cart**
  When the user clicks on the 'delete' button, the user should be able to delete the items in the Cart.


###Constraints
The Shopping Cart application must meet the following constraints:
**Technical Constraints**
  + The application must be built with the jQuery Javascript library.
  + The application must utilize the OLP.

**Design Constraints**
  + The various sections and elements of the Shopping Cart application are built by making each of the tests pass accordingly. Do well not to skip or delete any of the tests. They are very necessary in building every bit of the application.

###How to Run this Lab

+ Clone the repository
+ Open **index.html** in your browser to see the currently failing test specs you are to pass
+ Open the repository in your favorite text editor to explore the different files
+ Open **js\jscart.js** and write the function(s) or lines of code to pass the tests
+ You could refresh **index.html** in your browser intermittently to see the status of test specs.

###Notes

+ Remember that passing code is just the first step. The goal is to work towards a solution that is as readable and expressive as you can make
it.

+ Please make your solution as general as possible. Good code doesn't just pass the test suite, it works with any input that fits the specification.

Have fun!
