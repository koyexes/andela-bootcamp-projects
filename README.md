# ANDELA BOOTCAMP PROJECTS

###OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING ###

 This implements the object oriented paradigm. In this project Animal was used to model a class for different types of animal.
 Any type of animal can inherit from the Animal class and call methods defined in that class. For example in this project, a fish and a dog class was sub-classed from the Animal class, which gives them access to call methods defined in the animal class.
 
####Methods
  These are some methods from the animal class that can be called and over-ridden by subclasses
  + getName()
  + setName()
  + move()
  + eat()
  + setAge()
  + setColor()
  
####Example
  **var dog1 = new Dog("Bingo", 25, "Black");**
 

###DATA TYPE PROGRAMMING TASK
This implements a programming logic that checks the data type of the passed input and return appropriate messages.


###FINDING THE PRIME NUMBERS IN A SEQUENCE 
 This is a programming logic that filters out the prime numbers within a sequence of numbers based on the passed in limit of the sequence.
