# ANDELA BOOTCAMP PROJECTS

###OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING ###

 Any type of animal can inherit from the Animal class and call methods defined in that class.
 
 
  ####Methods
  
  These are some methods from the animal class that can be called and over-ridden by subclasses
  + getName()
  + setName()
  + move()
  + eat()
  + setAge()
  + setColor()
